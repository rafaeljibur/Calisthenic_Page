                <p>Calisthenics is a system of physical exercise where you only need your own body weight. It is a procedure of several exercises for a multitude of muscles and joints, routines that you can do at home, without the need for any specific equipment.
                </p>
                <p>In the ancient world, calisthenics was used as the main source of physical preparation for the military, as it was easy to organize, easy to learn, and had the greatest transfer to actual skills and movements that soldiers would need in combat. Something that really remains today for its practicality and contribution to the integral physical power of the troops combined with the aforementioned benefits.
